                        ## Problem statement
  Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients is growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.
Individuals with diabetes face a risk of developing some secondary health issues such as heart diseases and nerve damage. Thus, early detection and treatment of diabetes can prevent complications and assist in reducing the risk of severe health problems. Even though it's incurable, it can be managed by treatment and medication.  
###Motivation :- As a person who suffered from gestational diabetes I want to get better understanding of this disease among women and use machine learning models to identify patients who are at risk of diabetes.
###Objective:
To build a model to predict whether an individual is at risk of diabetes or not.
####DataSet Description:
1.Age:Age in years
2.weight :
3.Height:
4.gluc:Glucose level 
5.Cholesterol
6.active
7.smoke
8.Pressure: Ratio of high blood pressure/low blood pressure
9.alco: alcohol taken
10.diabetes = Target variable

###pipeline of project
1.Download the dataset
2.Datacleaning and Feature engineering :check null value in dataset and outlier treatment.or arrange the column in proper manner.
3.
