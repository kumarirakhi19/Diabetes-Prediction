## Problem statement
  
  
  Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients is growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.
Individuals with diabetes face a risk of developing some secondary health issues such as heart diseases and nerve damage. Thus, early detection and treatment of diabetes can prevent complications and assist in reducing the risk of severe health problems. Even though it's incurable, it can be managed by treatment and medication.  

###Motivation :- As a person who suffered from gestational diabetes I want to get better understanding of this disease among women and use machine learning models to identify patients who are at risk of diabetes.

###Objective:
To build a model to predict whether an individual is at risk of diabetes or not.

####DataSet Description:

1.Age:Age in years
2.weight :
3.Height:
4.gluc:Glucose level 
5.Cholesterol
6.active
7.smoke
8.Pressure: Ratio of high blood pressure/low blood pressure
9.alco: alcohol taken
10gender: male/Female
11.diabetes = Target variable

##pipeline of project

1.Download the dataset
2.Datacleaning and Feature engineering :check null value in dataset and outlier treatment or arrange the column in proper manner.
3.Exploratory data analysis: this set check which variable are realted to target variable and how they impact.checking the ralationship between Target variable  and variable 
4.Check dataset is balanced or imbalanced: for balancing the dataset applying smote oversampling.
5.test data ia prepared for implementing the model
6.Model implementation
7.Evaluation matrix : for checking our model is performing well or not.use confusion matrix for evaluation
8.result or conclusion
  
  
### challenges of model

1. Data is dirty .need more time on data cleaning
2. training dataset is less
3. dataset is four part csv file,need to combine


####  Need improvement : Due lack of time very less time given on eda or model implementation.
1. Required more eda on dataset
2. implement more model to check accuracy.

## Exploring of project
Diabetes  is among critical diseases and lots of people are suffering from this disease. Age, obesity, lack of exercise, hereditary diabetes, living style, bad diet, high blood pressure, etc. can cause Diabetes Mellitus.People having diabetes have high risk of diseases like heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, eye problem, nerve damage, etc. Current practice in hospital is to collect required information for diabetes diagnosis through various tests and appropriate treatment is provided based on diagnosis
